# Teach Me Like I'm a Noob: Broker Copilot

Welcome! If you're wondering what this project is all about without all the tech-heavy jargon, you're in the right place.

## The Big Idea
Imagine you're an insurance broker. You have **hundreds** of clients, and their policies are renewing at different times. If you miss one, you lose money and the client loses coverage. 

Right now, brokers have to check their CRM (HubSpot), look through their emails (Gmail), and check their meetings (Calendar) just to figure out who to talk to next. It's a mess.

**Broker Copilot** is like a super-smart personal assistant that does all that digging for you.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Connects the Dots**: It logs into your HubSpot (contacts/deals) and Google (emails/meetings).
2. **Finds the Matches**: It looks at an email from `client@domain.com` and thinks, *"Hey, this domain matches a deal in HubSpot!"* It automatically links them together.
3. **Calculates "Stress Level" (Priority)**: It looks at how much money the deal is worth, how soon it expires, and more importantly—**if the client is ghosting you**. If you emailed them 3 times and they haven't replied, their priority score goes through the roof!
4. **Writes for You**: It uses AI (Google Gemini) to read all those emails and write a summary. It even drafts outreach emails for you so you don't have to stare at a blank screen.

## Cool Features You'll Notice
- **The "Offline" Screen**: If the backend (the brain) stops working, the app doesn't just break and show you empty white boxes. It shows a professional "Offline" screen and tries to reconnect automatically.
- **No Emojis**: We kept it "Clinical-Grade." This is a serious business tool, so it looks clean, high-end, and professional.
- **What-If Simulator**: You can play around with numbers. *"What if this client's premium was $50,000 instead of $10,000? Would they be more important?"* The app tells you instantly.

## Why is this better than just using HubSpot?
HubSpot is a great filing cabinet, but it doesn't **think**. Broker Copilot analyzes your *actual interactions* (emails/meetings) to tell you who is at risk of leaving *before* they actually leave.
